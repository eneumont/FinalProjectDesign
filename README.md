# FinalProjectDesign
Just a simple text printing project that uses various design principles,
so like a singleton called "printer" that'll do all the printing,
a factory of different animal classes with various string properties that can be printed, etc.

This project will just be used for this class or maybe if I feel like printing something funny
in the future.
